            <p id="erl-vot">Early voting means casting your vote before the official election day.<br><br>
              It lets you vote on a different day, so you can avoid the crowds and long lines on election day. 
              You still get to vote for the same people and issues as on election day. There are different places where you can do early voting, so you can choose the one that's most convenient for you.
              Just like on election day, there are rules in place to make sure your vote is counted correctly. Your early vote is kept safe until election day, when all the votes are counted together, and that's when they announce the results.
              <br><br>Early voting is a flexible option that makes it easier for more people to have their say in choosing leaders.

            <h2 class="vot-qst">What is Absentee Voting?</h2>
            <p id="abs-vot">It is a process by which electors who are unable to go in person to the polling site on polling day can still cast their vote. 
            It is an important part of the electoral management process. There are many different systems to enable voting to take place other than on polling day at the polling site and these are valued by electors who because of health, disability, 
            employment or other reasons cannot get to their polling site in person.
